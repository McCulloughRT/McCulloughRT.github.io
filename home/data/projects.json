To test the correlation, we recorded all tweets originating from the Portland area over a week long period (over 24,000 total). Using semantic analysis, the content was categorized as positive or negative sentiment, and bots were filtered out. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm  was then used to identify natural geographic groupings of tweets that could define an area. Finally, existing hotels were plotted, clustered, and then seperated into catchment areas with a voronoi fractal. Clusters of positive tweets did in fact correlate spatially with high density catchment areas, encouraging further research into social media's predictive power."
