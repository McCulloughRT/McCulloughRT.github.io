Creating a React/Redux wrapper around Mapbox

This repo accompanies my [tutorial on wrapping Mapbox for React/Redux](https://medium.com/@mcculloughrt/react-redux-with-mapbox-78fa3767211e)

## To Use:
1. Clone the respository and 'npm install'
2. Change the 'TOKEN' variable in src/components/app.js to your Mapbox API token
3. Run 'npm start' from the root directory
4. If you utilize this style in a project please throw some credit my way ;)
