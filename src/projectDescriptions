
The Ackerly at Timberland:
Inspired Design, Picturesque Senior Living
Situated on a three-acre site with a very steep slope, Ankrom Moisan turned a challenging project into a uniquely planned building that steps beautifully down the hillside. Inspired by modern prairie design, the U-shaped building offers sweeping views of the valley and blends into the existing environment.

A southern-facing courtyard offers bountiful sunlight, and provides at-grade access from various points. These entries offer independent, assisted, and memory care residents the opportunity to enjoy a lush landscape in a secured area. Dining, activity spaces, a fitness center, and game room also offer opportunities for enjoyment and socializing.

The building uses predominately wood-framing and some post-tensioned concrete. A mixture of Hardie panels—horizontal siding and cementitious panels—lends the façade a residential look. Parking is on-grade, per the owner’s request.
